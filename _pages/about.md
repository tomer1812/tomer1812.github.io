I am a Ph.D. student at ShalitLab at the Faculty of Data and Decision Sciences, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. We specialize in machine learning and causal inference in healthcare.

My research has two primary objectives:

1. Developing machine learning and causal inference methodologies which can be used in many scientific domains.
2. Utilizing machine learning and causal inference techniques for healthcare applications to improve patient care.

I am a machine/deep learning researcher and developer experienced in various data modalities such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs), longitudinal data, tabular data, and imaging.

Prior to my Ph.D. journey, I was a researcher at Segal Lab, Weizmann Institute of Science (2020-2021). Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, most of my effort was to develop strategic tools for public-health officials and policymakers. We devised national symptoms surveys for identifying virus spread clusters, developed machine-learning models for predicting the future number of hospitalized patients and deaths, analysed what-if scenarios that project the consequences of various national strategies, and provided real-time assessment of vaccine effectiveness at the national level.

Before that, I was a member of the algorithms team at Zebra Medical Vision (2018-2019), where I developed deep-learning algorithms for the automated analysis of medical imaging, primarily CT scans and X-rays. These algorithms are now being employed by healthcare providers to enhance population health. One the main projects I worked on was the development of an automatic deep-learning-based system to identify Vertebral Compression Fractures (VCF) in Computed Tomography (CT) images. With an osteoporosis-related fracture occurring every three seconds worldwide, early detection of VCF is crucial to initiate preventive treatments. The system I developed has the potential to revolutionize osteoporosis clinical management, optimize treatment pathways, and alter the trajectory of one of the most challenging diseases of our time.
