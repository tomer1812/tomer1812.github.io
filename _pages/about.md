I am a Ph.D. student at ShalitLab at the Faculty of Data and Decision Sciences, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. 
We specialize in machine learning and causal inference in healthcare.

My research has two primary objectives:

1. Developing machine learning and causal inference methodologies which can be used in many scientific domains.
2. Utilizing machine learning and causal inference techniques for healthcare applications to improve patient care.

I am a machine/deep learning researcher experienced in various data modalities such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs), time series data, [time-to-event data](https://tomer1812.github.io/projects-pydts/), tabular data, and imaging.

Prior to my Ph.D. journey, I was a researcher at Segal Lab, Weizmann Institute of Science (2020-2021). [Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic](https://tomer1812.github.io/projects-covid/), most of my effort was to develop strategic tools for public-health officials and policymakers. 
We devised national symptoms surveys for identifying virus spread clusters, developed machine-learning models for predicting the future number of hospitalized patients and deaths, analysed what-if scenarios that project the consequences of various national strategies, and provided real-time assessment of vaccine effectiveness at the national level.

Before that, I was a deep learning researcher at Zebra Medical Vision (2018-2019), where I developed deep-learning algorithms for the automated analysis of medical imaging, primarily CT scans and X-rays. 
For example, early detection of vertebral compression fractures, which often remain undiagnosed, is crucial to initiate preventive treatments for osteoporosis.
One of the main projects I worked on was the development of an automatic deep-learning-based system to identify [vertebral compression fractures](https://tomer1812.github.io/projects-vcf/) in computed tomography (CT) images. 
These algorithms are now being employed by healthcare providers to enhance population health. 

I invite you to check out the dedicated pages for each of the main projects I worked on.
